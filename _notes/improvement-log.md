# Site improvement log

Working notes for the recurring "improve avinashgosavi.com" task. Not published
(Jekyll ignores folders starting with `_` that aren't collections).

## Ground rules (from Avinash)

- **Tone:** personal and curious, not resume-like. No resume metrics or stat
  cards ("1M+ devices", "30+ APIs") — they feel braggy on a personal site.
- **Never invent** opinions, experiences, attendance, awards or quotes. Only use
  facts from: this repo's existing posts/data, the resume in Google Drive
  (Avinash_Gosavi_Resume.pdf), Gmail ticket/registration emails, his public
  GitHub repos, and published papers/pages you actually read.
- **Privacy:** never publish health, finances, family, immigration, job-search
  or interview details, or anything from personal email beyond event tickets.
- **Small steps:** one focused change per commit, pushed to `main`; confirm the
  GitHub Actions deploy succeeds; fix immediately if it fails.
- Run `python3 scripts/og_cards.py` after adding a post (share-preview card).
- Validate YAML before pushing (`python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open(f))"`).
- Bigger content (new posts) must cite sources and stay factual; paper
  write-ups go in the `paper-tldr` series.

## Done (Oct 18, 2026)

- New pages: /events, /achievements, /research (papershelf + newsletters),
  /talks, /now, /uses, /series, 404, robots.txt
- Blog series support; VaultMem series; Paper TL;DR series (7 posts covering
  Hopfield 1982, Modern Hopfield, CLS, LoCoMo, Memory as Asset, Sentence-BERT)
- Projects 6 → 11, grouped by theme, demo links
- Experience updated from Oct 2026 resume
- Tags + filter chips on /blog; read-next links; share cards for all posts;
  Person JSON-LD; SEO fixes (duplicate title/description); image compression,
  lazy-loading; skip link; README documents data files

## Backlog (pick from the top; move to Done with a date)

- [ ] Add `description:` front matter to older posts that lack one (better
      search snippets than the auto excerpt)
- [ ] Check every post's `read_time` roughly matches word count (~230 wpm)
- [ ] Add alt text to any images missing it
- [ ] Projects: short "what I learned" line per project — ONLY from facts in
      the project's own post/README
- [ ] Events: link any other event to a recap if a post exists
- [ ] Dark-theme contrast check for new components (chips, labels, cards)
- [ ] Waiting on Avinash: favorite talks beyond SF Ruby, podcasts/YouTube,
      books, next papers to read (then add to /talks, a bookshelf, Paper TL;DR)
- [ ] Waiting on Avinash: LinkedIn post for the Paper TL;DR series (draft
      ready in chat; never post without his OK)

## Run history

- 2026-10-18 — manual session: everything under "Done".
